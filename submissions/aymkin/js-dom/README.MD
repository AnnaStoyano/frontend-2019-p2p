## The goal

Main goal - menu with ability to load some predefined html content related to own menu item into right-positioned <main> content container.

## Goals

- complex implementation of full page responsive layout (credit to Udacity course about responsive HTML/CSS).
- store data in an array of objects
- use innerHTML, insertAdjacentHTML, append, createElement, addEventListener,
- may find useful array methods as Array#filter, Array#sort, Array#find, etc.
- and of course - DOM methods.
